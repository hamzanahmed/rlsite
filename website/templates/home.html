                                <p>The Covid-19 pandemic has shut down activities in all spheres of life. Learning, and sharpening literacy skills is no exception. Literacy and Numeracy losses have yet to be quantified but it is safe to project that 6 months to a year has been lost between Kindergarten and 3rd grade. This means children entering 3rd grade will be performing on average at a 2nd grade level and so on.

                                    The Reading Lab is determined to not only stop this loss, but ensure children come out of the shut down with sharper literacy skills, ready for their grades.
                                    
                                    Our literacy program is now online. New assessments and placements can be done from the safety of your homes.

                        <p> The purpose of the Pre Reading Module is to develop attention and analytical skills in children between the ages of 2 and 3, and prepare them to follow a formal Direct Instruction Reading program. Following instructions is a pre requisite skill for reading as well for academic success. After 24 sessions, the child would be given a placement test, which will determine his/her ability to be enrolled for Reading Module 1 A. The Pre Reading module is based on the following four components.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>The Direct Instructional Reading program at the         Reading Lab follows four important points about an effective sequence for teaching reading. The sequence takes the child from simple to complex reading, using specific instructions at each level. So your child starts the programs with few reading – related skills. Within one hundred teaching days-about two-thirds of school year—your child reads, although not as well as an adult. But through the course of the lessons your child has learned to read       from traditional orthography (letters that make up words and how words are spelled) to read simple word stories that are 250 words long. By this time, s/he has learnt basic sentence comprehension, decoding and inferential skills and is ready to critically analyze a simple text presented to him/her.</p>

                        <p>Module 2, which follows the Direct Instructional Program, aims to further transfer, practice and builds on the skills developed in the earlier module. The purpose of this module is to teach a child to read fluently. Fluency is the ability to read accurately and quickly. Research proves that fluency development is important because fluent readers are able to devote energy to comprehension rather than having to focus all their efforts on word decoding. The ultimate goal of reading is to be able to analyze the text for which a student must bring to bear word recognition proficiency, syntactic knowledge (grammar, rules that govern language), background knowledge, comprehension monitoring and reasoning skills.<br><br><br><br></p>

                        <p>The primary focus of Module 3 is to increase the child's WCPM ( word correct per minute) to and help the student grasp the text and learn the rules that govern English language e.g. identifying different parts of speech and finding the root word and origin using a dictionary. Writing is an essential component of academic success. In this module, students are encouraged to write the material that they have read as they have perceived it, which is a pre requisite for creative writing in their junior school years.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>

A lot: <br>When children have a home library, as few as 20 books of their own at home (think: one bookshelf full), they achieve three more years of schooling than children who don’t have any books at home. <br><br>3. It doesn’t take much to read a lot of words:<br>Read 20 minutes a day, and you’ll read 1,800,000 words per year.<br><br>4. And all that reading pays off:<br>Children who read 1,000,000 words a year are in the top two percent of reading achievement<br><br>5. Reading is the fastest way to build vocabulary:<br>Children learn 4,000 to 12,000 words per year through reading.<br><br>6. Classroom libraries rule:<br>Kids in classrooms without classroom libraries read 50 percent less than kids in classrooms with libraries.<br><br>7. Every book counts:<br>If you read just one book a day to your child they will have been read 1825 books by their 5th birthday</p>

                                    <p>Fourth grade is a pivotal time for students as they transition from learning to read to reading to learn. Those who are not reading at grade level by this time will fall farther and farther behind as subjects such as math and science become more central. Students who can’t read proficiently by fourth grade are four times more likely to drop out of high school. And according to the US Department of Education, 60 percent of the United States’ prison inmates are illiterate, and 85 percent of all juvenile offenders struggle with reading. If we don’t provide reading interventions at an early age, the likelihood of poverty or incarceration increase dramatically.

As students who struggle with reading move through school, they get more and more frustrated when they can’t understand simple concepts, causing them to lose confidence, lose interest, and fall further behind their peers. </p>

The number of children in need of support is staggering, but if enough of us pitch in, even a little bit, we can reach a lot of those children and significantly alter the course of their lives by intervening right now before they fall even further behind. By supporting early literacy, you can make sure more students get the same opportunity you were given when you learned to read.</p>
